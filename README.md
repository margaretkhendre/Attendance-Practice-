## School District Attendance Analysis

_Data provided by an unnamed school county_

In this brief analysis,the resources labled with the number 7 aim to calculate these two values with the provided datasets:
- State-wide, the total count of schools and the average of the pct_chr_abs column across all schools.
- The same statistics, but aggregated by school level (ES, MS, HS).

The resources labeled with the number 8 aim to create a graph showing K-12 enrollment over the last decade by Metro RESA school district.
- Tableau is used to display the final graph in a neat and easy to read format
